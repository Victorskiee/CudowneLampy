According to the rules you have chosen, you encourage customers to <b>increase the value<\/b> of their purchases in order to take advantage of <b>free delivery<\/b>.<\/div>","additionalDescription":"Developing your sales by increasing the value of transactions has never been an easy thing to implement. The \u201cFree Delivery Manager\u201d module is actually the perfect solution for offering your respected customers free shipping through objective rules. It is the promise of <strong>a rise in the amount of orders<\/strong> with total <strong>control of delivery costs<\/strong>.<br \/><br \/>The module allows you to calculate in advance, with the help of precise rules, the necessary conditions for unlocking free delivery. The management and monitoring are done according to carriers, delivery area, price, weight, or any other criteria you term as important for your business.<br \/><br \/>The \u201cFree Delivery Manager\u201d module offers <strong>control of delivery costs<\/strong> by releasing delivery available as a function of criteria you have chosen. All the carriers have their own price list. You may, for example, indicate a minimum order amount by carrier<br \/>In presenting to the customer, in their order summary, the amount remaining before delivery is available, so you definitely encourage them to <strong>order more<\/strong>.<br \/><br \/>Highly detailed statistics visually present two types of reports together. The first one presents the number of orders that have benefited from free delivery, as well as the total and per-order amount that this cost you. You really <strong>control the impact<\/strong> of delivery costs.<br \/>The second report displays the detail of costs caused by free postage and the orders where the rules for free shipping are applied. Thus, the \u201cFree Delivery Manager\u201d module increases the value of transactions as well as the number of orders!<br \/><br \/>This module has been constantly evolving, many thanks to user feedback. TimActive, in fact, grants great importance to your perception of our solutions and of the improvements that can be added.\u00a0","tab":"shipping_logistics","version":"1.6.21","compatibility":{"from":"1.5.0.0","to":"1.7.8.1"},"nbRates":"74","product_type":"module","avgRate":"4.8","price":{"EUR":125.99,"USD":148.99,"GBP":110.99},"badges":[{"label":"PrestaShop's Favorite","img":"https:\/\/medias2.prestastore.com\/themes\/prestastore\/img\/front\/sprites\/badges\/ps-selected.png"},{"label":"Partnerski Kreator Modu\u0142\u00f3w","img":"https:\/\/medias2.prestastore.com\/themes\/prestastore\/img\/front\/sprites\/badges\/module-editor.png"}],"cover":{"small":"https:\/\/addons.prestashop.com\/691962-pprod\/free-delivery-manager.jpg","big":"https:\/\/addons.prestashop.com\/691962-pbig\/free-delivery-manager.jpg"},"changeLog":{"1.3.1":["Improve performance","Fixed bug with handling charge","Fixed checking best rule"],"1.3.3":["Feature Possibility if Many rule matching by carrier => best price or best weight","Fixed Better structure css, js","Feature Several matching rules exist for a carrier => possibility to select best free rule"],"1.3.4":["#Improve code and error  path Free delivery manager path js and css moved"],"1.4.0":["#Condition \/ check with cart or without cart rule","#Tax handling charge not include"],"1.4.1":["Error update configuration"],"1.4.2":["Fix bug to calculate free delivery in visitor mode"],"1.4.4":["Add link compatibility for 1.6.0.13","Add feature to add information in div"],"1.4.5":["Error path ajax.php"],"1.4.6":["delete mail reference in php and documentation, update support contact"],"1.5.2":["New feature add condition if additionnal shipping cost is included","New feature add statistic","New feature add specific form to update the address to calculate freeshipping","Override is more clean no impact with Prestashop upgrade","Test of configuration has bean added","Delete all  reference of timactive support"],"1.5.3":["Bug Fixed \/ firefox admin","Bug Fixed \/ state undefined javascript","Bug Fixed \/ id_group not defined"],"1.5.4":["Traduction lost in 1.5.3"],"1.5.6":["#FEATURE_MAXIMUM_WEIGHT Add Weight restriction(maximum weight) in free delivery rule","#FEATURE_MAXIMUM_WEIGHT Setting configuration for display the weight restriction"],"1.6.0":["Feature multi carrier order compatibility","Add 1.7 compatibility"],"1.6.1":["#Feature31 Improve Compatibility for visitor client"],"1.6.4":["add fr translation","FIX  visitor issue for address validation","FIX code Prestashop 1.7 compliance"],"1.6.16":["Fix compatibility with PHP 7"],"1.6.17":["Fix warning error display on prestashop 1.7.5 with php 7"],"1.6.21":["Fix cart rule calculation deduction after PS 1.7.4"]}},{"id":"8934","name":"migrationpro","displayName":"Narz\u0119dzie Prestashop do Aktualizacji i Migracji","categoryName":"Migracja & Backup","categoryId":"431","categoryParentName":"Administracja","categoryParentEnglishName":"Administration","categoryParentId":"440","description":"Natychmiastowa aktualizacja Prestashop 1.4, 1.5 lub 1.6 do Prestashop 1","author":"MigrationPro","url":"https:\/\/addons.prestashop.com\/pl\/migracja-backup\/8934-narzedzie-prestashop-do-aktualizacji-i-migracji.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-PL&utm_content=download","img":"https:\/\/medias1.prestastore.com\/img\/pico\/8934.jpg","fullDescription":"<div>Natychmiastowa aktualizacja Prestashop 1.4, 1.5 lub 1.6 do Prestashop 1.7!
